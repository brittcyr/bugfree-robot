1.
The purpose of MPBOOTPHYS is to convert to a physical address relative to
MPENTRY_PADDR. It is necessary in mpentry.S but not boot.S because mpentry.S
has already made the jump up to high address space while boot.S starts and
stays with low addresses. If it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S, the kernel
could not run because it would not have the right address.

2.
We need separate kernel stacks for each CPU because in the case that we have to
switch CPUs due to an interrupt, the other CPU could contaminate the stack and
when we restart the first CPU, it will not have the stack it expected.

3.
It is in kern_pgdir which is always mapped to the high addresses above UTOP.
This makes it so that the virtual address will always point to the same
physical address in each address space.

4.
It needs to save the registers so that when it restarts execution, it can have
the same state and be seamless as though there was no environment switch. This
happens in kern/trapentry.S where it pushal all the registers onto the stack.
It is recovered in env_run when it env_pop_tf to popal them off.
