Entry   Base Virtual Address    Points to (logically):
1023    0xffc0000               Page table for the top 4MB of memory
1022    0xff80000               Page table for the second to top 4MB of memory
960     KERNBASE                Page table for the bottom 4MB of memory
959     ULIM                    Kernel stack and invalid memory
956     UPAGES                  Page table mapping to "pages"
2       0x0080000               
1       0x0040000               
0       0x0000000               Nothing

The address space has been separated to have [ULIM, UTOP) is only for the
kernel.  The pages for the kernel were marked with different permissions. They
do not have the PTE_U bit set so they cannot be accessed by the user.


3. 
The operating system can support 256MB of memory. This is because we mapped
the kernel to the range [0xF0000000, 0xFFFFFFFF]. This is 256MB. So we cannot
map to any addresses higher.


4. 
There is one page directory. This takes up one page = 4KB. This points to
2^10 page tables which are each one page, so 2^10 pages. The overhead is (2^10
+ 1) * 4KB = 4MB + 4KB ~= 4MB.


5. 
We make the transition at kern/entry.S:68 when we jump to relocated. It is
possible to continue running at a low EIP because we mapped both [0,4MB) and
[KERNBASE,KERNBASE+4MB) to the low 4MB of physical address space. So once
paging is enabled, the mapping of the low addresses still works. The transition
is necessary to setup the rest of memory and leave the low addresses for users.
